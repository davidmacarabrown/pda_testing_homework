### Testing task 1:

# Carry out static testing on the code below.
# Comment on any errors that you see below.

Note that we are only looking for errors here.

**Not** any issues with, i.e.:
Thinking that methods should be renamed or should be class level, or using string interpolation etc.

These aren't errors but rather standards that vary from developer to developer.

Only comment on errors that would stop the tests running.

```python

class CardGame:


  def check_for_ace(self, card):
    if card.value = 1: #should be "==" when comparing values
      return True
    else  #colon missing after "else"
      return False


  dif highest_card(self, card1 card2): #def mis-spelled as "dif", comma missing after card1 parameter
  if card1.value > card2.value: #indentation is incorrect on this line and the three following
    return card #should be "card1"
  else:
    return card2



def cards_total(self, cards): #entire function is not indented correctly
  total #total is not initialised correctly - e.g. total = 0
  for card in cards:
    total += card.value
    return "You have a total of" + total
    #return statement must not be inside the for loop
    #total must be converted to a string to be combined in this way, alternatively a formatted string could be used.

```
